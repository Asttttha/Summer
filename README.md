## A summer-themed website created entirely by the Techie Tessie community!

We are offering you the chance to win Techie Tessie merchandise by showing us your coding skills!

From 16th May - 24th June you have the opportunity to contribute features and pages to this website.

We ask that you use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only - so that coders of all abilities are able to contribute.

The Techie Tessie team will then decide who made the best contribution.

The winner will be announced on a livestream held on the 2nd of July, which will be recorded and posted as our 100th video!
